Creating a Library Management System using Python involves managing essential functions such as user login, book cataloging, monitoring borrowing records, and producing reports on book availability and user activities. The system saves information about users and books in two text files, allowing access to updated data after the program is rerun. For example, when a book is borrowed, its status changes from available to borrowed.
